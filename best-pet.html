    <h1>About My Dog</h1>

    <p>I basically named the dog after my nickname, which is <strong>Petie</strong>, which is a short form of my full name <em>Petronilah</em>.</p>
    <p>It has this habit of always hanging around me everytime, be it when i'm working, watching Tv or even going to the shop.</p>
