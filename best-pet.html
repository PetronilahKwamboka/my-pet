    <h1 class="list-1">About My Dog</h1>

    <p id="p1">I basically named the dog after my nickname, which is <strong>Petie</strong>, which is a short form of my full name <em>Petronilah</em>.</p>
    <p id="p2">It has this habit of always hanging around me everytime, be it when i'm working, watching Tv or even going to the shop.</p>
    <p id="p3">At first i wasn't really sure if i wanted a dog as a pet because i could imagine them pooping everywhere around the house. This thought alone freaked me out, but the most surprising thing i found out was that, the dog will actually behave the way you train it.</p>

    <p id="p4">And that brings saying it's favorite activities</p>

    <ul class= "list-1">
      <li>Playing</li>
      <li>Eating</li>
      <li>Roaming and sniffing things around the house.</li>

    </ul>
